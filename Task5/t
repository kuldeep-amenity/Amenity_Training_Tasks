Pandas Task List:
Loading & Initial Inspection:
Load a CSV file (e.g., sales_data.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.
Display the first 7 rows of the DataFrame.
Display the last 7 rows of the DataFrame.
Find the shape (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.
List all column names of the DataFrame.
Display the data types of each column.
Get a descriptive statistical summary for all numerical columns.
Get a descriptive statistical summary for all columns (including object/categorical).
Check the number of unique values in each column.
Data Selection & Indexing:
Select and display a single column by its name (e.g., 'Product').
Select and display multiple specific columns by their names (e.g., 'Product', 'Price', 'Quantity').
Select and display the row at index position 3 (the 4th row).
Select and display rows from index position 5 to 10.
Set a meaningful column (e.g., 'OrderID') as the DataFrame's index.
Select and display a specific row using its new index label (e.g., if 'OrderID' 'XYZ123' is an index).
Select and display specific rows and columns using .loc[] (e.g., rows with index labels 'A', 'B' and columns 'Product', 'Region').
Select and display specific rows and columns using .iloc[] (e.g., rows at index positions 0, 2, 4 and columns at index positions 1, 3).
Filtering Data:
Filter and display all rows where a numerical column (e.g., 'Quantity') is greater than a certain value (e.g., 10).
Filter and display all rows where a categorical column (e.g., 'Category') is equal to a specific value (e.g., 'Electronics').
Filter and display rows that meet multiple conditions (e.g., 'Region' is 'West' AND 'Price' is less than 50).
Filter and display rows where a column's value is one of several specified values (e.g., 'Product' is 'Laptop', 'Mouse', or 'Keyboard').
Filter out rows where a specific column has missing values.
Data Cleaning & Manipulation:
Identify columns with any missing (NaN) values.
Count the total number of missing values in each column.
Fill missing values in a specific numerical column with its mean or median.
Fill missing values in a specific categorical column with a placeholder like 'Unknown' or the mode.
Drop all rows that have any missing values.
Drop a specific column by its name.
Create a new column by performing an arithmetic operation on two existing numerical columns (e.g., 'TotalPrice' = 'Quantity' * 'Price').
Convert a column containing date strings to the datetime data type.
Extract the month or year from a datetime column into a new column.
Rename one or more columns.
Change the data type of a column (e.g., from float to integer, if appropriate).
Find and remove duplicate rows from the DataFrame.
Apply a custom function to each element in a Series/column (e.g., convert text to uppercase).
Grouping & Aggregation:
Group data by a single column (e.g., 'Category') and calculate the sum of another column (e.g., 'Revenue') for each group.
Group data by a single column and calculate the mean of another column.
Group data by multiple columns (e.g., 'Region', 'Category') and count the number of occurrences in each group.
Find the minimum and maximum values of a numerical column for each group.
Calculate the number of unique items in a column for each group (e.g., unique products per category).
Get the size of each group after grouping.
Use agg() to apply multiple aggregation functions at once after grouping.
Sorting & Ranking:
Sort the DataFrame by a single column in ascending order.
Sort the DataFrame by a single column in descending order.
Sort the DataFrame by multiple columns.
Combining DataFrames (Use multiple small datasets):
Concatenate two DataFrames vertically (stacking them).
Merge two DataFrames based on a common key column (like a SQL join).
